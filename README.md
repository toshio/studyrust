# Study Rust

## Introduction

I am interested in Internet Computer, a distributed cloud computer.

Backend Canister uses a WASM Runtime called Wasmtime, and Rust is used as popular language in addition to a dedicated language called 'Motoko.'

It is effective to repeat "copying and executing samples" to learn a programming language.
