# Study Rust

## Introduction

I am interested in [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/), a distributed cloud computer platform developed by [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/).

Backend Canister uses a WASM Runtime called [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is used as popular language in addition to a dedicated language called '[Motoko](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko).'

So, I've started study Rust.

Here are is the history of what I studied.

It is effective to repeat "copying and executing samples" to learn a programming language.
